    <h1 style="color:rgb(31, 182, 167);">About the Course</h1>
    <p>Explore the concepts, methods, and applications of differential and integral calculus, 
        including topics such as parametric, polar, and vector functions, and series. 
        Youâ€™ll perform experiments and investigations and solve problems by applying your knowledge and skills.</p>
    <h3 style="color:rebeccapurple">The Exam</h3>
    <p>The AP Calculus BC Exam will test your understanding of the mathematical concepts covered in the course units, 
        as well as your ability to determine the proper formulas and procedures to use to solve problems and communicate 
        your work with the correct notations. A graphing calculator is permitted for parts of the exam. Note: You may 
        not take both AP Calculus AB and Calculus BC Exams within the same year.</p>
