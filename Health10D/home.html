<div id="bed">
    <img src="bed.png" class="beds" height="40px" width="90px">
    <div class="bedtxt"><p>I chose the bed to represent my physical health since a vital part of physical wellness comes from sleep, and without a trusty place 
        to sleep, there can be no physical wellness. I also still struggle with sleep despite often being tired, which is also why I chose a bed in particular to represent my physical health.</p>

<div id="sexual">
    <img src="sh.png" class="sh" height="34px" width="80px">
    <div class="shtxt"><p>I chose a poster of the line "ask for consent" because it emphasizes asking for consent and thus non-violent and non-coercive relationships, which are very important for sexual wellness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flagtxt"><p>I chose a Korean flag to represent Multiculturalism because I am part Korean and 
        both during my childhood and the present Korean culture has been a part of my life, such as Korean food and holidays. I think this connects well with the tolerance and acceptance and justice motifs in  
        Multiculturalism

<div id="calcbook">
    <img src="calcbook.png" height="20px" width="90px" class="cbook">
    <div class="cbooktxt"><p>I chose a Barron's AP Calculus book to represent my Intellectual dimension because I often
        like to self study things like math and science. This self-studying has been a massive contributor to my intellectual 
        health so that's why I specifically chose this to represent it.
    </p></div>

<div id="vsc">
    <img src="vsc.png" height="50px" width="100px" class="vscode">
    <div class="vsctxt"><p><span style="color:white">I chose a picture of code to represent my occupational wellness because while I</span> don't currently have a job yet, the career I want to pursue is 
        computer science and I often spend time learning computer science and programming on my own, hence why I chose the code to represent occupational wellness.
    </p></div>

<div id="piggybank">
    <img src="piggybank.png" height="50px" width="80px" class="bank">
    <div class="banktxt"><p>I chose a piggy bank to represent my financial dimension of Wellness because my personal financial goals and savings have all basically been through 
        saving up money in "piggy banks" (really just envelopes on my desk) then finally depositing most of it when I created a debit account. Saving up is a huge part of my financial 
        wellness, and I hardly spend in anywhere besides lunches, so again that's why I chose a piggy bank.

<div id="emo"><button type="button" id="emob" onclick="showEmotxt()">Emotional</button></div>

<div id="social">
    <img src="backpack.png" class="so" height="170px" width="90px">
    <div class="sotxt"><p>I chose a backpack to represent my social wellness, because the primary source of my social wellness, my friends, are really only seen in person at or after school these days, so I usually have my backpack with me, hence why I chose the backpack to represent this.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div id="spiritual">
    <img src="phone.png" class="sp" height="50px" width="20px">
    <div class="sptxt"><p>I chose a phone to represent my spiritual wellness, because while I no longer consider myself spiritual or religious in a beliefs sense, one of the other mentioned aspects of spiritual wellness is connection with like-minded people, and for me, and likely most others, the most convenient way for me to connect with similar minded people and friends is via my device.</p>
